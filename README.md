# Tribute-page
Simple Tribute page for Nelson Mandela

A tribute page is basically an overview of someone whom we admire in our life. In this I would created a tribute webpage of Late Nelson Mandela Sir using HTML and CSS.  I add an image of him at the center (below the title) and create a box beneath that image. Inside that box, I would wrote a few of his achievements and details. I would use div tag and p tag to write the details and img tag for image. Then using CSS,I align and beautify the design.
